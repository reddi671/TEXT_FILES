It looks like you are encountering a class-related issue while upgrading Magento. The error message indicates that the class `Magento\Indexer\Console\Command\IndexerInfoCommand\Interceptor` does not exist. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Clear Cache:**
   Clear the Magento cache to ensure that any outdated or conflicting files are not causing the issue. You can do this by running the following command in the Magento root directory:

   ```bash
   bin/magento cache:clean
   ```

2. **Recompile:**
   Try recompiling the code by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   bin/magento setup:di:compile
   ```

   And then clear the cache again:

   ```bash
   bin/magento cache:clean
   ```

3. **Check for Interceptor Files:**
   Make sure that the generated interceptor files are present in the `generated/code` directory. If there is an issue with code generation, it might be necessary to delete the content of the `generated` directory and run the compilation and cache clearing commands again.

   ```bash
   rm -rf generated/*
   bin/magento setup:di:compile
   bin/magento cache:clean
   ```

4. **Review Code Changes:**
   If you are upgrading Magento, make sure that all code changes and updates are properly applied. Check if there are any conflicts or missing files in your Magento installation.

5. **Magento Version Compatibility:**
   Ensure that the extensions and custom code you are using are compatible with the version of Magento you are upgrading to. Some extensions might need updates to work with newer versions.

6. **Check for Missing Dependencies:**
   Verify that all required dependencies are installed. You can check the `composer.json` file for required packages and run `composer install` to ensure all dependencies are installed.

7. **Log Files:**
   Check Magento's log files for more detailed error messages. The log files are usually located in the `var/log` directory.

8. **Rollback:**
   If the issue persists, consider rolling back to the previous version and investigating the issue further before attempting the upgrade again.

If none of the above steps resolve the issue, you may need to consult Magento's official documentation or seek assistance from the Magento community forums for more specific guidance related to the version you are upgrading to.
