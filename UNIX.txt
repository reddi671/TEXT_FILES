execution flow:
--------------

command execution flow:

$ promt means normal user
# prompt means root/super user

sudo -i: to switch to root user we can use sudo -i then we can see # prompt on terminal

Online unix terminal:  http://www.masswerk.at/jsuix

commanly used commands:
------------------------

1)pwd - print working directory
2)ls - list out all files under directory
3) mkdir - to create/make a directory
4) cd - chnage the directory
5 touch - to create a empty file
6  rmdir - to remove the directory
7 rm - to remove the file
8 cal = to display calender
9 date = to display current date and time

11 clear
12 exit to logout 
13 hello = to display brief system info


FILES SYSTEM:

root is topmost file under this
bin 
devices
home --> 
etc


LINUX FILE SYSTEM:
-------------------
types of files in linuc/unix:  
------------------------------
in linux files extesnion is not important. Based on content files type automcatically  detected
in python everything is treated as object 
in linux evrything is trested as a file
 1 Normal / Ordinary file --> 
 ------------------------------
 these files conatin data. these can be normal text files or binary files(images, videos, audio files)
 2 Directory Files  --->
 ----------------------------

 3 Device Files --> 
 -------------------
 in linux evry device is treated as file. by using this files we can communicate with that file 
inside /dev directory all device files will be there

terminal ==> file tty --> command will give termial /dev/pts/0

echo "I love" > /dev/pts/0   one terminal communicate with other terminal  > --> is called redirect
 

 ls -l ==> command used to know the type of file
 - normal file,
 d directory file
 l linked file
c==> character special file
b===> block special file
s===> socket file 	
 
 LINUX file system hierarchy:
 ----------------------------
 linux files system has tree like structure and it starts with root(/)
 / is the top most tdirectory
 sub directories are : bin etc home lib dev usr cdrom


 1)bin and 2)sbin

 3)etc: constains all the system configuration files. these  configuration files will be used by operating system itself

 etc/passwd ===> all users information
 /etc/group ==> all groups info
 /etc/hosts ==> All hosts information is available( ip address nd dns names)
 4) tmp Directory:
 -----------------
 LINUX installation:
 --------------------
 1) Oracle virtual installation 2) Ubantu installation


 man command: ex=> man ls  to know about command
 IF  A FILE END SWITH * IT IS EXECUTABLE FILE
 @ SYMONL MEANS LINK FILE

 ls =>list
 ls -r => in reverse alphabetical order
 ls -l => long listing form in alphabetical order
 ls -t =>created/ last modified time
 ls -lt =>created/lst mofified with time
 ls -ltr => most recent will be bottom and old will be top
 ls -a   => -a means all
 ls | wc -l
 ls -a|wc -l
 ls -A => means alsomt all except . and .. files will be displayed
 ls -F => to display all files using type
 ls -F/bin 
 ls -f  => to disable colours and will disply list of all files and directors
 ls -i  => to display all files include inode number inode => means index node
 ls -R  => recursive    inside direcory what files are also there
 ls -s  =>  -s means size  for ex: 1block = 1kb
 ls -h  =>  human readable form for memory statics
 NOTE: 
 ls -l /etc | head  top 10 will give
 ls -l /etc | head -20
 ls -l /etc |tail -20
 ls -l /etc  | more/less next and previous pages 


 cat /etc/passwd

 GROUPSS:Groups are collections of zero or more users. A user belongs to a default group, and can also be a member of any of the other groups on a server.
 /etc/group 
 /etc/passwd 


 FILE PERMISSIONS:
 Mode and permissions breakdown


   drwxrwxrwx    r - read, w- write, x - execute
   d for file type
1) rwx USER
2) rwx GROUP
3) rwx OTHer
Permissions Classes
From the diagram, you can see that the mode column indicates the file type, followed by three triads, or classes, of permissions: user (owner), group, and other. The order of the classes is consistent across all Linux systems.
The three permissions classes work as follows:

User: The owner of a file belongs to this class.
Group: The members of the fileâ€™s group belong to this class. Group permissions are a useful way of assigning permissions on a given file to multiple users.
Other: Any users that are not part of the user or group classes for this file belong to this class.

 
Filters
Filters are are a class of programs that are commonly used with output piped from another program. Many of them are also useful on their own, but they illustrate piping behavior especially well.

find - returns files with filenames that match the argument passed to find.

grep - returns text that matches the string pattern passed to grep.

tee - redirects standard input to both standard output and one or more files.

tr - finds-and-replaces one string with another.

wc - counts characters, lines, and words.
