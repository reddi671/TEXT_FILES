In the context of Bitnami Magento, the process of resolving issues might be a bit different due to the specific configuration and deployment of Magento by Bitnami. Here are some steps you can take to address the error in Bitnami Magento:

1. **Backup:**
   Before making any changes, it's crucial to create a backup of your Magento application and database. This ensures that you can revert to a stable state if needed.

2. **Clear Cache:**
   Clear the Magento cache to make sure that any cached or outdated files are not causing the issue. Use the following command in the Bitnami Magento directory:

   ```bash
   ./bin/magento cache:clean
   ```

3. **Recompile and Regenerate Interceptors:**
   In Bitnami Magento, you might need to run the following commands to recompile the code and regenerate interceptors:

   ```bash
   ./bin/magento setup:di:compile
   ```

   ```bash
   ./bin/magento setup:di:generate
   ```

   After running these commands, clear the cache again:

   ```bash
   ./bin/magento cache:clean
   ```

4. **Check File Permissions:**
   Ensure that file and directory permissions are set correctly. Bitnami Magento often requires certain permissions for different directories. You can refer to Bitnami's documentation for Magento to check and set the correct permissions.

5. **Review Bitnami Documentation:**
   Bitnami typically provides documentation for their Magento stack. Check the Bitnami Magento documentation for specific guidance on upgrading Magento instances deployed through Bitnami.

6. **Check for Bitnami Updates:**
   Verify if there are any updates or patches for the Bitnami Magento stack. Bitnami may release updates to address compatibility issues with newer versions of Magento.

7. **Bitnami Support:**
   If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Bitnami support forums or contacting Bitnami support directly. They may have specific insights into common issues and resolutions related to their Magento stack.

8. **Magento Version Compatibility:**
   Ensure that the version of Magento you are upgrading to is compatible with the Bitnami Magento stack version you are using. Some custom configurations in Bitnami Magento might need adjustments when upgrading to newer Magento versions.

Remember that Bitnami configurations may differ from standard Magento installations, so it's essential to refer to Bitnami's documentation and support channels for guidance specific to their Magento stack.
